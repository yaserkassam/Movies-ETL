# Movies_ETL

## Overview
The focus of this challenge was to learn about the data pipeline process called ETL(Extract Transform Load). We took Data from both csv files and json file. Also, after extracting the data we were tasked in learning how to clean the data and have it ready and structured with the information we need. Lastly, loaded the data into PostgreSQL and have our movies_df and ratings_df. This allows the data that we extracted in its raw form, cleaned the data so it was more readable, and lastly loaded our tables to PostgreSQL for it to be used in the hackathon that other coders would use as a starting point.
